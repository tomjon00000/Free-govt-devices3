        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Understanding Free Government Devices</h2>
        <p>
            Access to a reliable device has become a necessity for modern life. Whether you are trying to stay connected
            to family, attend online classes, search for jobs, or manage healthcare appointments, having a working 
            smartphone or tablet plays a crucial role in daily life. That is why several assistance programs across the 
            United States aim to help qualifying individuals receive free or discounted devices. While benefits may vary 
            by state, many households are surprised to learn they could be eligible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Programs related to free government devices are generally designed to support low-income families, seniors 
            living on fixed incomes, individuals participating in government assistance programs, and households facing 
            temporary hardship. This guide walks you through the essentials — from understanding how programs work to 
            exploring trusted resources that can help you take the next step.
        </p>

        <h2 id="programs" class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Programs That May Offer Free Devices</h2>
        <p>
            Several national and regional providers participate in device support initiatives. While each program has 
            its own rules, many follow similar guidelines. Under certain programs, eligible applicants may receive a 
            smartphone, tablet, or hotspot. Some may require a small co-pay, while others may offer devices at no cost 
            depending on funding and inventory availability.
        </p>

        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Common Features of These Programs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Device options may include smartphones, tablets, or hotspot devices.</li>
            <li>Availability may differ depending on the applicant’s state and provider capacity.</li>
            <li>Applicants usually need to show eligibility through income or participation in assistance programs.</li>
            <li>Support may also include limited voice, text, or data benefits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="eligibility" class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Eligibility Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Eligibility criteria will vary, but most programs require proof that a household meets certain income 
            thresholds or participates in qualifying benefits such as SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, Federal Public Housing, or 
            other recognized support programs. Some programs may also extend eligibility to students, veterans, or 
            individuals living in tribal lands.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's important to remember that no program can guarantee a free device for every applicant. However, many 
            families find the process easier than expected once they gather the necessary information and explore 
            trusted resources. Below, we have curated helpful links to assist you in understanding available options.
